# quiet-hours.sh — Claude Code PreToolUse hook: refuse tool calls inside
# the quiet hours the user set for themselves.
#
# Honest limits of this mechanism (see ENFORCEMENT.md):
#   - Blocks tool calls (the work), not model text (the answers).
#   - Hooks fail open by platform design: a timed-out or broken hook does
#     not block. This is a speed bump, not a wall.
#   - Overridable through a deliberate typed act (ai-limits override),
#     which is honored for 8 hours, logged, and counted — never refused.

🛏️ Your quiet hour limits ($QUIET_START-$QUIET_END) are in effect, which means tool calls are paused.

(You can adjust your settings if needed)
